    ">PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE<br> AND COMPUTING</h2>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-<br>for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and<br> Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech<br> fields like</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud Native Computing</li><br>
        <li>Artificial Intelligence</li><br>
        <li>Blockchain</li><br>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h1>Cloud Native Computing:</h1>
    <p>The <b>Cloud Native Computing </b>program prepares the students to program in open source<br>
        technologies like <b><i>Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</i></b><br>
        While introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development<br>techniques on cloud platfroms like AWS</p>
        <br>
    <h1>Artificial Intelligence:</h1>
    <p>The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes student through the foundation of the AI<br>
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like <b><i>Python, Numpy, Pandas</i></b><br>
        <b><i>Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask,</i></b> and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and<br> 
        ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice</p><br>
        <h1>Blockchain:</h1>
        <p>The main emphasis of <b>Blockchain</b> program is to understand the blockchains like <b><i>Ethereum<br>
             and Hyperledger (Fabric),</i></b> and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on<br>
            frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed Apps<br>
            (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and in-depth understanding of Blokchain-as-a-<br>service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering(ICO) of a crypto-token</p>
